> Prepare a fresh Debian 13 server for your Laravel app — ready for Deployer PHP.

**berth** is a command-line tool that provisions a freshly installed Debian 13
(Trixie) VPS into a production-ready web server for Laravel applications. It
connects over SSH and applies an idempotent pipeline (nginx, PHP-FPM, MariaDB,
Valkey, Supervisor, firewall, TLS, hardening), leaving the server ready for a
separate deployer ([Deployer PHP](https://deployer.org)) to ship code.

A *berth* is the prepared place where a vessel docks: berth readies the server,
then the deployer brings the code alongside.

## Install

Prebuilt binaries are published for Linux, macOS, and Windows (amd64/arm64) on
the [Releases](https://github.com/robsonek/berth/releases) page. No runtime is
required. Download the archive that matches your OS and architecture, extract
the `berth` binary, and put it on your `PATH`.

```bash
# example (Linux amd64) — replace VERSION with the release you downloaded
tar -xzf berth_VERSION_linux_amd64.tar.gz
chmod +x berth && sudo mv berth /usr/local/bin/
berth --version
```

On Windows, download the `.zip` archive for your architecture, extract
`berth.exe`, and add its location to your `PATH`.

## Usage

```bash
berth init                            # interactive wizard → servers/<name>.yml
berth provision servers/<name>.yml    # provision the server (idempotent)
berth provision servers/<name>.yml --dry-run   # preview changes only
```

## Highlights

- **Single, dependency-free binary** for Linux, macOS, and Windows — no runtime
  to install on your machine or the server (beyond SSH).
- **Idempotent** — safe to re-run; it only fills in what is missing.
- **Declarative** — a server is described by a version-controllable, secret-free
  config file.
- **Safe by default** — anti-lockout SSH hardening, a least-privilege deploy
  account, secret redaction, and explicit host-key verification.

## How it works

`berth init` walks you through an interactive wizard and writes a per-server
config. `berth provision <server>` then connects over SSH and brings the host to
the desired state through an ordered pipeline of idempotent steps. Re-running is
always safe; `--dry-run` shows what would change.

## Package sources

By default every component is installed from Debian 13's own repositories. Where
a newer version is wanted, a per-component `source` selects a trusted upstream
apt repository whose signing-key fingerprint is pinned in berth and scoped with
`signed-by`:

```yaml
php:
  version: "8.5"
  source: sury        # auto | sury | debian   (Debian ships 8.4; Surý provides 8.5)
nginx:
  source: nginx       # debian | nginx         (nginx.org mainline)
database:
  engine: mariadb
  source: mariadb     # debian | mariadb        (mariadb.org 11.8 LTS)
```

Each defaults to `debian`. An upstream source aborts the run if the fetched key
does not match the pinned fingerprint.

## Beyond v1

v1 covers `berth init` and `berth provision` (one server and its first site,
MariaDB). MySQL 8 / PostgreSQL engines, multi-site (`berth site:add`), and
package-manager distribution are planned for later releases. See the
[design specification](docs/design/2026-06-13-berth-design.md) for the full
scope.
