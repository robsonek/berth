> Prepare a fresh Debian 13 server for your Laravel app — ready for Deployer PHP.

**berth** is a command-line tool that provisions a freshly installed Debian 13
(Trixie) VPS into a production-ready web server for Laravel applications. It
connects over SSH and applies an idempotent pipeline (nginx, PHP-FPM, MariaDB,
Valkey, Supervisor, firewall, TLS, hardening), leaving the server ready for a
separate deployer ([Deployer PHP](https://deployer.org)) to ship code.

A *berth* is the prepared place where a vessel docks: berth readies the server,
then the deployer brings the code alongside.

## Install

Prebuilt binaries are published for Linux, macOS, and Windows (amd64/arm64) on
the [Releases](https://github.com/robsonek/berth/releases) page. No runtime is
required. Download the archive that matches your OS and architecture, extract
the `berth` binary, and put it on your `PATH`.

```bash
# example (Linux amd64) — replace VERSION with the release you downloaded
tar -xzf berth_VERSION_linux_amd64.tar.gz
chmod +x berth && sudo mv berth /usr/local/bin/
berth --version
```

On Windows, download the `.zip` archive for your architecture, extract
`berth.exe`, and add its location to your `PATH`.

## Usage

```bash
berth init                            # interactive wizard → servers/<name>.yml
berth provision servers/<name>.yml    # provision the server (idempotent)
berth provision servers/<name>.yml --dry-run   # preview changes only
```

## Highlights

- **Single, dependency-free binary** for Linux, macOS, and Windows — no runtime
  to install on your machine or the server (beyond SSH).
- **Idempotent** — safe to re-run; it only fills in what is missing.
- **Declarative** — a server is described by a version-controllable, secret-free
  config file.
- **Safe by default** — anti-lockout SSH hardening, automatic security updates,
  a tuned fail2ban jail, HSTS, a least-privilege deploy account, secret
  redaction, and explicit host-key verification.

## How it works

`berth init` walks you through an interactive wizard and writes a per-server
config. `berth provision <server>` then connects over SSH and brings the host to
the desired state through an ordered pipeline of idempotent steps. Re-running is
always safe; `--dry-run` shows what would change.

## Configuration reference

A server is one YAML file in `servers/<name>.yml`. `berth init` can generate
**any** of the configs in this README interactively — the advanced sections
(fail2ban, tuning, per-site queue/daemons) sit behind optional prompts, so the
common path stays short — or you can write the file by hand. Every field, with
its default and accepted values:

```yaml
host: 203.0.113.10             # required — server IP or DNS name

ssh:
  user: root                   # default root — the login user berth connects as
  port: 22                     # default 22
  key: ~/.ssh/id_ed25519       # path to your private SSH key
  fingerprint: ""              # optional host-key pin "SHA256:…"; empty = trust
                               # on first connect (TOFU, confirmed interactively).
                               # Pin it to defeat MITM — get the value with:
                               #   ssh-keyscan -t ed25519 HOST | ssh-keygen -lf - | awk '{print $2}'

```

Generated passwords are cached in a gitignored `.berth/` directory (the secrets
file is mode 0600) and reused across runs — never rotated. The thematic sections
below explain each area in depth.

## Package sources

By default every component is installed from Debian 13's own repositories. Where
a newer version is wanted, a per-component `source` selects a trusted upstream
apt repository whose signing-key fingerprint is pinned in berth and scoped with
`signed-by`:

```yaml
php:
  version: "8.5"
  source: sury        # auto | sury | debian   (Debian ships 8.4; Surý provides 8.5)
nginx:
  source: nginx       # debian | nginx         (nginx.org mainline)
database:
  engine: mariadb     # mariadb | postgres
  source: mariadb     # mariadb engine: debian | mariadb (mariadb.org 12.3 LTS)
                      # postgres engine: debian | pgdg   (apt.postgresql.org / PGDG)
```

Each defaults to `debian`. `database.source` accepts `debian` or the chosen
engine's producer repo (`mariadb` for MariaDB, `pgdg` for PostgreSQL). An
upstream source aborts the run if the fetched key does not match the pinned
fingerprint.

## Performance

berth tunes the host for production Laravel out of the box:

- **OPcache** is configured for production (`opcache.validate_timestamps=0`, with
  sized memory / interned-strings / accelerated-files). FPM SAPI only, so
  long-running CLI workers never serve stale bytecode.
- **Valkey** (when `valkey: true`) is wired as the cache, session and queue
  backend in the seeded `.env`, each site isolated on its own Redis logical
  database. Without Valkey the app keeps the database driver. This wiring is
  written when berth first creates a site's `shared/.env`, so enable `valkey`
  before the initial provision (flipping it on later does not rewrite an
  existing `.env` — remove it or re-seed by hand).
- **HTTP/3 (QUIC)** is available per site with `http3: true` (requires `ssl` and
  `nginx.source: nginx`); berth also opens UDP/443.
- nginx serves fingerprinted Vite assets under `/build/assets/` with a one-year
  cache and gzip, and raises `client_max_body_size` for typical uploads.

### Service tuning (`tuning:`)

berth applies conservative, managed tuning drop-ins automatically:

- **Valkey** (when `valkey: true`) — a systemd drop-in sets `maxmemory` and
  `maxmemory-policy` so the cache evicts instead of returning OOM errors once
  full (Debian's default is `noeviction` with no `maxmemory`, so a full cache
  fails writes).
- **MariaDB** (when `database.engine: mariadb`) — a `mariadb.conf.d` drop-in
  sets `innodb_buffer_pool_size`.

Every value is overridable; omit a field to keep its default:

```yaml
tuning:
  valkey_maxmemory: 256mb              # default
  valkey_maxmemory_policy: allkeys-lru # default; any Valkey eviction policy
  mariadb_innodb_buffer_pool: 256M     # default
```

With one shared Valkey for cache, session and queue, `allkeys-lru` can evict
queued jobs under memory pressure; use `volatile-lru` to evict only keys that
carry a TTL.

### Deploy hook (required with OPcache)

Because `opcache.validate_timestamps=0`, new code is served only after PHP-FPM is
reloaded. berth does not deploy code, so after your deployer swaps the release
symlink it must reload FPM (and restart any running queue worker):

```php
// deploy.php (Deployer) — berth grants the site user exactly this reload, nothing more
after('deploy:publish', function () {
    run('sudo systemctl reload php{{php_version}}-fpm'); // clear OPcache -> serve new bytecode
});
// plus: php artisan queue:restart  (or horizon:terminate) so a running worker picks up the new code
```

## Security & hardening

Every provision hardens the host (in addition to the anti-lockout SSH drop-in,
which disables root login and password authentication only after verifying the
`berth` admin account can connect with a key and sudo):

- **Automatic security updates** — the APT periodic config is written so
  `unattended-upgrades` actually applies updates (the package alone is inert
  without it).
- **fail2ban** — a managed jail bans SSH brute-forcers (bound to your configured
  SSH port) and repeat offenders (`recidive`). Tunable, with safe defaults:

  ```yaml
  fail2ban:
    bantime: 1h       # ban duration
    findtime: 10m     # window failures are counted in
    maxretry: 5       # failures before a ban
  ```

- **TLS** — HTTPS sites with a real (Let's Encrypt) certificate send HSTS
  (`max-age` one year) and use a modern TLS profile (TLS 1.2/1.3, strong ciphers,
  session tickets off); self-signed sites deliberately omit HSTS.
- **Log rotation** — per-site PHP-FPM and Supervisor program (queue worker +
  daemon) logs are rotated so they never fill the disk.
- **Firewall** — `ufw` allows only SSH and 80/443 (plus UDP/443 with HTTP/3).

## Scheduler, queue workers & daemons

berth installs Laravel's scheduler as a per-site cron running `php artisan
schedule:run` every minute as the site's own user. It is **on by default**; set
`scheduler: false` server-wide, or `scheduler: false` on an individual site, to
skip it (disabling it on a re-run removes the cron).

With `queue: true` berth installs a dormant Supervisor `queue:work` program per
site. Tune that worker — or replace it with **Horizon** — and add arbitrary
long-running processes, per site:

```yaml
queue: true                  # server-wide default: a queue:work worker on every site
sites:
  - domain: app.example.com
    deploy_path: /var/www/app
    queue:                   # tune this site's worker (omit to keep the default above)
      processes: 4           # numprocs
      connection: redis
      queue: default,emails
      tries: 3
      timeout: 90
      max_memory: 256        # MB
    # queue: horizon         # …or run Laravel Horizon instead of queue:work
    daemons:                 # arbitrary long-running programs (full command)
      - { name: reverb, command: php artisan reverb:start }
```

Every program is installed **dormant** (`autostart=false`) — your deployer starts
and restarts them; berth never runs them. `queue: horizon` emits an `artisan
horizon` program instead of `queue:work` (Horizon runs single-process and manages
its own workers, so the `queue:work` knobs don't apply; configure it in your app's
`config/horizon.php`, and note it needs the Redis/Valkey queue driver). Each site
user gets **narrow sudoers** to control only its own programs, and Supervisor is
installed whenever any site declares a worker or a daemon.

## Multiple sites (isolated per domain)

List several `sites:` to host multiple domains on one server. Each site runs
under its **own dedicated OS user**, so a compromise of one site cannot read
another's files (its `deploy_path` is owned by that user, traversable only by
nginx; its PHP-FPM pool, queue worker and cron all run as that user), and each
site gets **its own database + user**:

```yaml
database:
  engine: postgres        # server-wide engine + source
  source: pgdg
sites:
  - domain: app-one.example.com
    deploy_path: /var/www/app-one
    user: app_one          # optional; derived from the domain when omitted
    database: { name: app_one, user: app_one }
    ssl: true
    ssl_email: admin@example.com
  - domain: app-two.example.com
    deploy_path: /var/www/app-two
    database: { name: app_two, user: app_two }
    ssl: true
    ssl_email: admin@example.com
```

A single-site config may keep the legacy top-level `database: { name, user }`
and the shared `deploy` user; with multiple sites each site needs its own
`database` block, and the OS users must be distinct.

Each TLS site uses Let's Encrypt by default; set `ssl_mode: selfsigned` on a site
to generate a self-signed certificate instead (no public DNS or `ssl_email`
needed — handy for staging or internal hosts).

## Beyond v1

`berth site:add` (incremental add) and package-manager distribution are planned
for later releases. See the
[design specification](docs/design/2026-06-13-berth-design.md) for the full
scope.
